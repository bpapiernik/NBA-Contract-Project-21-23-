# NBA-Contract-Project

This project uses Machine Learning methods to predict NBA contracts based on traditional, advanced, defensive, usage, and raptor statistics for each player and their AAV contract for the past 3 years.

From there, the project was able to calculate which NBA teams had the most "value" based on predicted and actual salaries for each of the past 3 seasons
