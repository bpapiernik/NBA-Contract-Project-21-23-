# NBA-Contract-Project

This project uses Machine Learning methods to predict NBA contracts based on traditional, advanced, defensive, usage, and raptor statistics for each player and their AAV contract for the past 3 years.

From there, the project was able to calculate which NBA teams had the most "value" based on predicted and actual salaries for each of the past 3 seasons. I calculated a ratio of Salary to Salary Cap to remove the weight of player's being paid more in the most recent year because of the constant increase in the salary cap each year.
